A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem

1) We will be using toronto Postal code data containing boroughs and neighbourhood from below wikipedia page 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M 

2) then we will fetch Latititude and longitude for each postal code.

3)  We will be dividing the city into four zones or clusters
    this will be done using k-means algorithm 

3) Once city is divided into four region then we will use four square data to identify 3 locations in each zone which has maximum number of venues
   If we have neigbourhood with more than 20 venues , we identify 3 places which have maximum pizza stores
   If we have neighbourhood with only 1 venue we identify only 1 place having maximum pizza store.
