    "Reason behind choosing places having maximum venues and then maximum pizza places is that we wanted to open store where there is maximum footfall ( number of people visitng that location ) , since the brand name is big ,  People will come to restaurant and where existing pizza places are there they might be near to Offices , Shopping or metro location . So We decided the open the stores in the places where people visit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also did chose 3 locations in crowded places , since we might get into issues in finding space for pizza place at right price , since we have 3 places to open a store in that cluster we will choose the best availlable place at right price.\n",
    "Location where venues are less we only choose 1 place since it should be an issue to find a place there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also as a recommendation I would prefer and suggest to company to open more pizza places in Cluster 0 , since cluster 0 has many places were number of venues is more than 100 , the store in this cluster is expected to be crowded and Busy . Until they decide to open more locations in Cluster 0 , they should at least have more staff working at that place."

Since Company is getting into Torornto area, so opening 4 stores across Toronto is a good starting point and with time for expansion more stores located in cluster0 should come up . Number of Staff memebers should be more in Cluster0 region than other regions\n",
